## Dear Red Angus Friends

It is a pleasure to welcome you to our 47th Annual Loosli Red Angus Production Sale. We appreciate
the many years of support and owe our customers a special thank you for choosing our genetics. We are
reminded daily how fortunate we are to be involved in the cattle business and count this as one of our
blessings. Being part of the ever-growing Red Angus breed is something we take great pride in. Through
these many years, we have been continually striving to improve our herd, being consistent yet progressive.
Our program continues by stacking generations of proven genetics to move your program forward. We
custom fit these genetics to your unique situation because your satisfaction is our continued success.

We are in some interesting times in the cattle industry, yet the Red Angus Breed continues to move
forward and lead the industry with tremendous interest and demand. Red Angus cattle have proven
themselves with low-maintenance, high fertility/maternal qualities, calving ease, and of course, great
dispositions. These many natural advantages have contributed to the tremendous growth in the Red Angus
breed. This is where you can count on our program to improve genetics and help you remain profitable. We
want to increase value to your herd...not low-cost production or high-cost production, but rather, efficient
production to wean more calves. Balance! We strive for balance because bulls that are balanced in many
areas are more profitable. We are confident about the vast and varied quality we are offering and feel we
have something that will benefit any cattle operation.

Our sale is packed with established genetics from breed-influencing sires and dams. This bull offering
features some exciting genetics with the numbers to match. Take a look at The New ProS Index (Profitability
and Sustainability Index) published by the Red Angus Association. It covers/rates economically relevant
traits from conception to carcass. This updated informational index works with the HerdBuilder and
GridMaster indexes as a reliable selection tool to help producers make more profitable cattle decisions. You
can view the 13 traits under the New ProS Index section on the inside back cover of this catalog. Please
note.... This current sale group of bulls is rated excessively high with 3⁄4 of the bulls in the top 30% of the
New ProS Index!

The Red Angus replacement heifers are some of the fastest growing components of the beef business.
They have been labeled as the Most-Favored Female. “Data from Superior Livestock has shown that Red
Angus females command up to $11/cwt more than females of all other breed types...” You will love our
great selection of 75 stylish heifers and will be impressed with their natural muscle, wide tops, great udders,
and sound disposition. Their characteristics of fertility, longevity, adaptability, and efficiency keep them at
the top. Because every herd sire begins with a powerful mother, we make sure our heifers have an
outstanding combination of great pedigrees and carry a very well-balanced set of EPDs.
You can see for yourself these outstanding traits as we run the bulls and heifers through the sale ring.
If you are wondering about social distancing, you can view the cattle any time before the sale or watch the
online videos on our website. We have great people to assist you. We also want to thank our tried-and-true
ranch help that perform the valuable day-to-day tasks!

We are extremely proud of our sale selection this year and welcome your calls to discuss your cattle needs.
Please look through the catalog and visit our website at www.Loosliredangus.com to view pictures, videos,

We want to invite you to our ranch in Ashton, Idaho, on Tuesday, March 9, 2021 to have a delicious
lunch on us and be a part of this great sale. As mentioned, you can also watch and bid online through
