## Dear Red Angus Friends

It is our pleasure to welcome you to the 51st Annual Loosli Red Angus Production Sale. Last year was a great celebration, and this year we move onto our next milestone. With over 50 years of raising and selling cattle comes many years of improvements, but one thing that has remained the same...our great customers! Without you, we would not be in business. We sincerely appreciate your many wonderful years of support. We are reminded daily how fortunate we are to be involved in the cattle business and count this as one of our many blessings.

The Red Angus Breed continues to move forward and lead the industry with tremendous interest and demand. Prices are tops and it looks like they will remain that way. The Red Angus cattle have proven themselves with natural advantages like low-maintenance, high fertility/maternal qualities, calving ease, and of course, great dispositions. This is where you can look at our operation for quality and profitability.

We have put together a very solid set of bulls this year with genetics from breed-influencing sires and dams. This bull offering features some exciting new genetics with the numbers to match. You will also notice the select, well-known sires in the pedigree charts. Their outstanding traits are carrying through to our herd as anticipated. This group of bulls has something that will benefit any cattle operation, and we can help you find what improves your herd. We have several top-notch herd bull prospects along with bulls that you can use on your heifers. We have something for your operational needs.

Our cow herd is and has always been a primary focus. We take a lot of pride in our cow herd. A key component of any herd is the Red Angus replacement heifers. They have been labeled as the Most-Favored Female and are renowned for their longevity in the herd. We make sure our sale heifers have outstanding combinations of great mothering traits, natural muscle, wide tops, great udders, and of course, sound disposition to help move your herd forward. Choose a bull and youâ€™ll know its mother. We also have been calving for about two months now and you need to see some of these calves. You will want these genetics in your herd!

View these outstanding traits for yourself as we run the bulls and heifers through the sale ring. Come see the cattle any time before the sale or watch the online videos on our website. We are extremely proud of our sale selection this year and welcome your calls to discuss your cattle needs. We have people to assist you and thank our hard-working ranch hands that help perform valuable day-to-day tasks!

Please look through the catalog and visit our website at loosliredangus.com to view pictures, videos, and current EPDs of our powerful genetics. We will have scanned data as well as the fertility testing available on the website prior to the sale.

We want to invite you to our ranch in Ashton, Idaho, on Tuesday, March 11, 2025, to have a delicious lunch and be part of this great sale. You can also watch/bid online through [LiveAuctions.TV](https://liveauctions.tv/auction/4531/detail).

Thanks again for these 51 wonderful years!

Brian and Karen Loosli & Family
