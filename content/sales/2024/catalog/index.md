## Dear Red Angus Friends

It is our pleasure to welcome you to the 50th Annual Loosli Red Angus Production Sale. Yes, with 50 years comes many years of changes and improvements, but one thing that has remained the same is our great customers. Without you, we would not be in business. We sincerely appreciate your patronage and thank you for your many wonderful years of support! We are reminded daily how fortunate we are to be involved in the cattle business and count this as one of our many blessings. Being part of the ever-growing Red Angus breed is something we take great pride in. The Red Angus Breed continues to move forward and lead the industry with tremendous interest and demand. Red Angus cattle have proven themselves with low-maintenance, high fertility/maternal qualities, calving ease, and great dispositions. You can count on these traits at Loosli Red Angus!     

We have put together a very solid set of bulls this year with genetics from breed-influencing sires and dams. This bull offering features some exciting genetics with the numbers and phenotype to match. Numbers alone are not enough. Their outstanding traits are carrying through to our herd as anticipated. This group of bulls has traits that will improve any cattle operation from several top-notch herd bull prospects to heifer bulls. We can honestly say that we have the best set of complete bulls to sell.  We strive for balanced bulls; they are more profitable. Heifers: The Red Angus replacement heifers are some of the fastest growing components of the business. They’ve been labeled as the Most-Favored Female and are renowned for their herd longevity. Rebuilding, maintaining, or starting a great herd begins with replacement heifers. We make sure our sale heifers have outstanding combinations of great mothering traits, natural muscle, wide tops, great udders, and sound disposition. These past two months we’ve been calving, and you should see some of these calves!  One of our best sets of calves ever.

See these outstanding traits for yourself as we run the bulls & heifers through the sale ring. Come view the cattle before the sale or watch the online videos on our website, www.Loosliredangus.com. You can also preview the bulls at VeltKamp Livestock in Manhattan, MT. We are extremely proud of our sale selection this year and welcome your calls to discuss your cattle needs. We have people to assist you and thank our hard-working employees. Please look through the catalog and visit our website to view pictures, videos, and current EPDs. 

We invite you to our ranch in Ashton, Idaho, on Tuesday, March 12, 2024, to have a delicious lunch and be part of this great 50th celebration. You can also watch/bid online through [LiveAuctions.TV](https://liveauctions.tv). Thanks again for these 50 wonderful years!

Thank you,

Brian and Karen Loosli & Family
